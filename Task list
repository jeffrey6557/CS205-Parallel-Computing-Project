Tasks

--------------------Completed----------------
1.Literature review on parallel neural net (all) 
Found Downpour SGD parallelism and combined MPI-OpenMP implementation 

2.Experimental design (205 Experimental design.docx)
2.1. define problem statement: neural network inputs and outputs 
2.2. define backtesting procedure 

3.Prototyping - get a small-scale project working
3.1. preprocess data sample (GS_sample.csv) (Chang)
3.2. sample neural network code (pseudocode.ipynb,pseudocode.docx) 

-----------------------To-do--------------------
3.3. implement feature-engineering and backtesting procedure in Python: (Chang)
input: preprocessed stock data files
output: input numpy matrix X and output vector Y 

3.6  implement various evaluation metrics and graphics (Kamrine)
input: predictions, output vector Y
output: accuracy and speed performance metrics tables/plots (see design doc)  

3.5. implement Downpour SGD and fully-connected multi-layer perceptron* on Odyssey using Python openMP and MPI packages: (Lingling, Greyson) 
input: input numpy matrix X (T by M) where T is the time and M the number of features, and output vector Y
output: a model that takes in new matrix X and returns a vector of predictions
* if possible, please try to allow variaions in parameters (# layers, neurons, activations, learning rate, etc). see design for more details. 

3.7 connect the pipeline, run a small experiment and populate the preliminary results on the website (DUE 15 April)


4. Scale-up the project
4.1 data include more stocks, more indicators 
4.2 vary the architecture to include local connections 
4.4 cross validate on optimal parameters
4.5 run the experiments at scale

(by 23th April?)

5. write up sections of papers 
5.1 introduction 
5.2 literature review
5.3 data and prediction method
5.4 arichiteure
5.5.experimental results
5.6 conclusion
